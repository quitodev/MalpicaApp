# MalpicaApp

MalpicaApp is an application linked to a stock control system that I developed some time ago (MalpicaSoft), which lets you manage and get the control of each purchase and sale made by a business.

Using the application, you can practically make all the same operations as if you were using the software, adding the possibility of having all the information, not only on the PC, but also on a smartphone.

The project is finished but it is not published in any store, because I prioritized working on other projects I was working on at the same time.
